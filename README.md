# Tensor-Flow-Project--5--

<table>
  
**In this project we'll be applying Transfer Learning to solve very famous Food Vision 101 challenge of Image Classification using EfficientNet-V2 and ResNet-50 V2. **

**Let's looks into dataset:** <br></br>

**About Dataset**: <br></br>
This dataset consists of 101 food categories, with 101'000 images. For each class, 250 manually reviewed test images are provided as well as 750 training images. On purpose, the training images were not cleaned, and thus still contain some amount of noise. This comes mostly in the form of intense colors and sometimes wrong labels. All images were rescaled to have a maximum side length of 512 pixels.
Here I will be expanding the classes from 2 in previous project to 10 in this project.<br></br>

**Before jumping to the code lets understand what is TensorFlow and What do you mean by Transfer Learning problem and What is CNN?**...<br></br>

**What is a TensorFlow?** <br></br>

TensorFlow is a free and open-source software library for machine learning and artificial intelligence. It can be used across a range of tasks but has a particular focus on training and inference of deep neural networks. It was developed by the Google Brain team for Google's internal use in research and production. <br></br>

**What is a Classification?** <br></br>

Classification is a supervised machine learning process of categorizing a given set of input data into classes based on one or more variables. <br></br>

**What is a CNN(Convolution Neural Network)?** <br></br>

A convolutional neural network (CNN) in TensorFlow is a type of artificial neural network that uses deep learning to process and recognize images. CNNs are a key technique in computer vision and are used in many applications, including face recognition and driverless vehicles.<br></br>
